# POSITIONING

## RELATIVE

### Set up so that a child element of this container can be positioned absolute relative to its parent container.

### Setting an element to relative position will allow you to move the element around relative to where it originally was. The space will remain where the element was originally positioned.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## ABSOLUTE

### Set an elements postion to absolute when you want to position it relative to its parent container. This will take the element out of the document flow and its space will not be saved.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## FIXED

### Positioning elements relative to the view port itself
